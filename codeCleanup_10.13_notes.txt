Going through some code cleanup.  Here are just
some random  notes I feel like jotting down during the process.

- Should display the custom tags user creates before cloud tag initialized
  ~ Create way for user to click on these words to remove them
  ~ If I create a way for user to remove words like this, I'll need to rewrite my 'createID' f(x) to avoid creating objects with the same tag IDs   

- When I get the bootstrapped site going, need to write a better
explaination of what the web app does, and how to use it.

- script.js --> change hardcoded weight value?

- Have to add the ability to use the 'enter' key for the twitter tag generator like I've added to the field for the custom tags

- Have to read the related Licenses for using the cloud tag template and credit / alter my code accordingly

- Have to alter the callback f(x) for the tags
  ~ Would like to make it so that the browser asks the user if he/she would like to navigate to the link contained in the tweet -- or in cases where the tweet has no link, the browser simply alerts something else (tweet text most likely)
  ~ On the same note, a quick Google search shows that if I want to make it more likely that a page will open in a new tab rather than a whole new window, I should set the 'target' attribute of the 'a' element to something unique for each link...thus, I could set it to the IDs belonging to each tweet

- When user creates custom tag clouds, initializes them, then presses the button again, the web app should not double the number of tags

- Must test for what happens when user puts in bad/unexpected input (e.g. searching for '@twitter_handle')

- Alter code so that user can keep getting the ten tweets before the current set of ten

- Does Bootstrap require <!DOCTYPE html> declaration??  If so, what can I use to design a webpage that only works in quirks mode?
  --> Bootstrap uses HTML5 implementations, and thus DOES require this declaration at the beginning of the html.  Thus, I need to figure out a way to work around this.
  --> The author may have used quirks mode because he used the deprecated DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha -- try modern CSS3 filters (opacity) as an alternative
