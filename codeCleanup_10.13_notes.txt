* 10/13/2014 3:42:41 PM *  Going through some code cleanup.  Here are just
some random  notes I feel like jotting down during the process.

- Should display the custom tags user creates before cloud tag initialized
  ~ Create way for user to click on these words to remove them
  ~ If I create a way for user to remove words like this, I'll need to rewrite my 'createID' f(x) to avoid creating objects with the same tag IDs   

- When I get the bootstrapped site going, need to write a better
explaination of what the web app does, and how to use it.

- script.js --> change hardcoded weight value?

- Have to add the ability to use the 'enter' key for the twitter tag generator like I've added to the field for the custom tags
