Brainstorm for Search Cloud Auto Refresh - 

November 19th, 2014 - 10:11 PM
Trying to figure out the best way to have the search cloud automatically 
refresh.  This is going to be complex at best, hell at worst.

First, altered cloud.js file so that the tag spans would be rendered 
with classes attached to them.  Also created a f(x) that gives each 
tweet cloud an ID that matches its 'little object' id.  

The reason I didn't get as far as I would have liked to today is that 
I though it'd be cool if the search cloud tweets disappeared one by one, 
and then reappeared one by one upon loading each new set of ten tweets to 
display.  But I'm finding this much more difficult to accomplish than I though I would.  I'm going to call it a night, and maybe I'll do better when I come back here tomorrow with a clear head and a fresh pair of eyes.
